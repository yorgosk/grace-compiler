6/04/2017 -- version 1.0

***Stable Version for Parts I and II of the project***

>   Our compiler is currently on the first stage of it's development. For now, it has Lexer and Parser capabilities. It
    processes the argument's program and, after it decides that it is correct (meaning that it conforms with our
    grammar's specifications), it prints it's Parsing Tree. If it decides that the program is not correct, it produces
    some basic error messages to help the user-programmer find what's wrong and correct it.
