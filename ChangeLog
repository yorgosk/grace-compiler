PROJECT'S CHANGELOG -- Last update 6/04/2017
Here we list our most important changes and all of our stable-version releases up to this date.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6/04/2017 -- version 1.0

***Stable Version for Parts I and II of the project***

>   Our compiler is currently on the first stage of it's development. For now, it has Lexer and Parser capabilities. It
    processes the input's program and, after it decides that it is correct (meaning that it conforms with our
    grammar's specifications), it prints it's Parsing Tree. If it decides that the program is not correct, it produces
    some basic error messages to help the user-programmer find what's wrong and correct it.

23/03/2017 -- version 0.5

***Stable Version for Part I of the project***

>   Our compiler is currently halfway through the first stage of it's development. For now, it only has Lexer
    capabilities. It processes a program, given to it manually, through the terminal, and it isolates it's lexical
    components.
